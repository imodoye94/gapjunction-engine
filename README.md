# GapJunction

An open-source AI-native data integration engine for healthcare and life science businesses, built with TypeScript and designed for modern healthcare interoperability.

## Overview

GapJunction is a comprehensive data integration platform and workflow automation engine (think, Mirth Connect + Zapier) that enables seamless data exchange between healthcare systems and automates manual back-office tasks for healthcare and life science businesses - Hospitals, Clinics, Laboratories, Digital Health Statups, Biotechnology companies, Contract Research Organizations etc. Basically anyone in healthcare. It provides AI-powered data mapping and transformations, real-time data processing, hardware + software integrations, and secure data handling to bridge the gaps in healthcare data interoperability.
